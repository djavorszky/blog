The (current) styling of this hurts my dark-theme loving eyes.

But I don't want to fall into the trap that I always fall into: don't put content out because I'm working on the blog (engine) itself.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) will do. In fact, it is probably more powerful, and has more features than what I'll ever need. It's also much faster and more robust than what I could ever build.

So yes, eleventy will do.

Also, testing:

```rust
  fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!")
  }
```

<div class="warning"> So.. does this work? </div>
